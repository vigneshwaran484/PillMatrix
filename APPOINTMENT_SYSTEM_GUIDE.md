## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error
- **Cause**: Firestore security rules not set
- **Fix**: Add security rules in Firebase Console

### "No doctors found"
- **Cause**: No users with role="doctor" in Firestore
- **Fix**: Register at least one doctor account

### Appointments not showing
- **Cause**: Date comparison issues
- **Fix**: Check that dates are properly converted from Firestore Timestamps

### TypeScript errors
- **Cause**: Missing type definitions
- **Fix**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for errors
