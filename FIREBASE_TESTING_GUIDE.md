# Firebase Appointment System - Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Appointments were not being stored in Firebase because the system was using email addresses instead of Firebase UIDs.

**Solution:** Updated all components to use Firebase UID (`user.uid`) for patient and doctor identification.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added `uid` field to `UserData` type
- User object now includes Firebase UID when authenticated
- UID is automatically added when user logs in

### 2. **AppointmentScheduler** (`src/components/AppointmentScheduler.tsx`)
- Now uses `user.uid` instead of `user.email` for `patientId`
- Validates that UID exists before creating appointment

### 3. **PatientDashboard** (`src/pages/dashboards/PatientDashboard.tsx`)
- Fetches appointments using `user.uid` instead of `user.email`

### 4. **DoctorDashboard** (`src/pages/dashboards/DoctorDashboard.tsx`)
- Fetches appointments using `user.uid` instead of `user.email`

### 5. **PrescriptionWriter** (`src/components/PrescriptionWriter.tsx`)
- Uses `user.uid` for `doctorId` when creating prescriptions and health records

---

## How to Test

### Step 1: Clear Old Data (Important!)

Since we changed from email to UID, you need to start fresh:

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - https://console.firebase.google.com/project/pillmatrix/firestore

2. **Delete old collections (if they exist):**
   - Click on `appointments` collection ‚Üí Delete collection
   - Click on `healthRecords` collection ‚Üí Delete collection
   - Click on `prescriptions` collection ‚Üí Delete collection

3. **Clear browser data:**
   - Press `F12` ‚Üí Console tab
   - Run: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Close and reopen browser

### Step 2: Register Users

**Register a Doctor:**
1. Go to login page

## Console Debugging

### Expected Console Messages

**When registering:**
```
üî• Firebase initialized with project: pillmatrix
üìù Registration attempt: {email: "...", role: "..."}
‚úÖ Using Firebase registration
‚úÖ Firebase user created: ...
‚úÖ User profile saved to Firestore
```

**When logging in:**
```
üîê Login attempt: {email: "...", projectId: "pillmatrix"}
‚úÖ Using Firebase authentication
‚úÖ Firebase authentication successful
üë§ Auth state changed: signed in ...
üìã User profile loaded from Firestore: {uid: "...", name: "...", role: "..."}
```

**When scheduling appointment:**
```

```

**When confirming appointment:**
```
‚úÖ Appointment status updated
```

**When writing prescription:**
```
‚úÖ Prescription created: [id]
‚úÖ Health record created: [id]
```

### Common Issues

**"User not authenticated properly"**
- Cause: User UID is missing
- Fix: Logout and login again
- Check: Console should show `uid` in user object

**"Permission denied"**
- Cause: Firestore security rules not set
- Fix: Add security rules (see APPOINTMENT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md)

**"No doctors found"**
- Cause: No users with role="doctor"
- Fix: Register a doctor account first

**Appointments not showing**
- Cause: Using old email-based data
- Fix: Delete old collections and start fresh

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

After completing all steps, you should have:

- [x] 2 users in Firestore (1 doctor, 1 patient)
- [x] 1 appointment in Firestore (with UIDs, not emails)
- [x] 1 health record in Firestore
- [x] 1 prescription in Firestore
- [x] Patient can see their appointment
- [x] Doctor can see and confirm appointments
- [x] Doctor can view patient records
- [x] Doctor can write prescriptions
- [x] All data linked by UID

---

## Next Steps

Once testing is successful:

1. **Add Firestore Security Rules** (see APPOINTMENT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md)
2. **Test with multiple patients and doctors**
3. **Test appointment cancellation** (future feature)
4. **Add email notifications** (future feature)

---

## Troubleshooting

If appointments still don't show:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Check Firestore console** to see if data is being created
3. **Verify UID** is present in user object (console log)
4. **Clear browser cache** and localStorage
5. **Restart dev server** (`npm run dev`)

If you see any errors, share the console output for debugging!
