## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No activities showing

**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Check if user is logged in
4. Verify patientId is correct

**Fix:**
```javascript
// In console, check:
console.log('User:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('pillmatrix_user')));
```

### Issue: Activities not updating in real-time

**Check:**
1. Firestore rules are deployed
2. Internet connection is active
3. No console errors

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Clear cache
- Re-deploy Firestore rules

### Issue: "2 hours ago" not changing

**This is normal!** The timestamp shows when the activity was created. If it says "2 hours ago", that activity was created 2 hours ago. New activities will show "Just now".

### Issue: Pharmacist can't see pending prescriptions

**Check:**
1. Are there any prescriptions with status="pending"?
2. Check Firestore Console â†’ prescriptions collection
3. Look for documents with `status: "pending"`

**Fix:**
- Create a new prescription as doctor
- Check that status field exists
- Verify Firestore rules allow read access
